My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chase
he soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to
ee her running down the field trying te cotch the
all with her mouth. It just won't fit!

Once Sasha saved my life. When I wes enly 4 years old, I started te go into the strest to get a ball that
had rolled ocross the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and
knecked me baekwards ento the sidewelk. I wes mod until I sew the car go by where I would heve been.
Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!
